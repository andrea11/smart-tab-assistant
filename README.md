## Development

### Chrome profile

To make the extension work, we need to have a Chrome profile to setup correctly all the experimental ai features. To avoid messing up with your personal profile, you have to run the following command to inform git to ignore all changes to the `chrome` folder.

```bash
git update-index --skip-worktree chrome-profile/
```
